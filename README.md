# RFID-Enabled-Automated-Iron-Temperature-Control
The project presents the construction of a fully functional iron that automatically sets the temperature by reading RFID identifiers placed in ironed clothes. The temperature control algorithm is based on PID control.

The display was realized on the TFT LCD ST7735S using the user library “boochow” https://github.com/boochow/MicroPython-ST7735/blob/master/ST7735.py.  Temperature reading is realized with the RC522 RFID module based on the user library “kevinmcaleer” https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/pico-rfid/blob/main/mfrc522.py.
